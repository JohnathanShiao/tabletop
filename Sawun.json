See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting. To cast one of these spells, you use its casting time and other rules, but you don't need to provide material components for it.\nOnce you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend additional ki points to increase the level of an elemental discipline spell that you cast, provided that the spell has an enhanced effect at a higher level, as burning hands does. The spells level increases by 1 for each additional ki point you spend. For example, if you are a 5th-level monk and use Sweeping Cinder Strike to cast burning hands, you can spend 3 ki points to cast it as a 2nd-level spell (the discipline’s base cost of 2 ki points plus 1).\nThe maximum number of ki points you can spend to cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cost and any additional ki points you spend to increase its level) is determined by your monk level, as shown in the spells and Ki Points table."

You and your adventuring companions can except to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other establishd presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components for spells.  Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle. \n You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be at the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While newar your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assisatance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple."
