  "description": "Gods of light\u2014including Helm, Lathander, Pholtus, Branchala, the Silver Flame, Belenus, Apollo, and Ke-Horakhty\u2014promote the ideals of rebirth and renewal, truth, vigilance, and beauty, often using the symbol of the sun. Some of these gods are portrayed as the sun itself or as a charioteer who guides the sun across the sky. Others are tireless sentinels whose eyes pierce every shadow and see through every deception. Some are deities of beauty and artistry, who teach that art is a vehicle for the soul's improvement. Clerics of a god of light are enlightened souls infused with radiance and the power of their gods\u2019 discerning vision, charged with chasing away lies and burning away darkness.",
