  "description": "Gods of trickery\u2014such as Tymora, Beshaba, Olidammara, the Traveler, Garl Glittergold, and Loki\u2014are mischief-makers and instigators who stand as a constant challenge to the accepted order among both gods and mortals. They're patrons of thieves, scoundrels, gamblers, rebels, and liberators. Their clerics are a disruptive force in the world, puncturing pride, mocking tyrants, stealing from the rich, freeing Captives, and flouting hollow traditions. They prefer subterfuge, pranks, deception, and theft rather than direct confrontation.",
